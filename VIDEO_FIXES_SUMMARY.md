# VIDEO THUMBNAIL AND DASHBOARD RECORDING FIXES

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Video Thumbnails Not Showing in Message List ✅
**Problem:** Video thumbnails weren't displaying because the code was still checking for the old `message.videoRecording` field that was removed.

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/components/dashboard/message-list.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/video-gallery.tsx` 
- `src/components/dashboard/video-selection-dialog.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed references to `message.videoRecording`
- Updated all video URL checks to use only `message.cipherBlobUrl`
- Fixed video preview logic to use Supabase Storage URLs

### 2. Dashboard Recording Not Saving ✅
**Problem:** Dashboard recordings were using localStorage (data URLs) instead of uploading to Supabase Storage, so they disappeared after refresh.

**File Fixed:**
- `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-recording.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `MediaService` import
- Updated `saveAsMessage()` function to upload to Supabase Storage
- Removed localStorage data URL approach
- Now uses `cipherBlobUrl` field for video URLs
- Added proper error handling

## How It Works Now

### Video Thumbnails
1. **Create Message Dialog** → Records video → Uploads to Supabase Storage → Saves URL to `cipherBlobUrl`
2. **Message List** → Checks `message.cipherBlobUrl` → Displays video thumbnail
3. **Video Preview** → Uses `cipherBlobUrl` for playback

### Dashboard Recording
1. **Dashboard Recording** → Records video/audio → Uploads to Supabase Storage → Saves as message with `cipherBlobUrl`
2. **Message persists** after refresh because it's stored in Supabase database
3. **Thumbnail displays** correctly because it uses the Supabase Storage URL

## Testing Steps

### Test Video Thumbnails
1. Create a new message with video recording
2. Check that video thumbnail appears in message list
3. Click thumbnail to verify preview works

### Test Dashboard Recording
1. Go to dashboard recording section
2. Record a video
3. Click "Save as Message"
4. Refresh the page
5. Verify the recording persists and shows thumbnail

## Expected Results
- ✅ Video thumbnails display in message list
- ✅ Dashboard recordings save permanently
- ✅ Videos persist after page refresh
- ✅ All video URLs use Supabase Storage
- ✅ No localStorage fallback (as requested)

## Console Logs to Watch For
- "Video uploaded to Supabase Storage: [URL]"
- "Audio uploaded to Supabase Storage: [URL]"
- Video thumbnail click events
- Media preview rendering logs
