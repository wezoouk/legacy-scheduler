# Audit Logs & System Backup - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented fully functional **Audit Logs** and **System Backup** features, plus added a visual indicator system for non-functional features throughout the app.

## âœ… New Features

### 1. Audit Log System (`src/lib/audit-log.ts`)

Complete audit logging infrastructure that tracks:
- User logins (success)
- Failed login attempts
- User logouts
- Password changes
- Profile updates
- Admin access
- Settings changes
- Message creation/deletion
- Recipient management
- System backups

**Features:**
- Stores up to 1000 log entries in localStorage
- Automatic event tracking integrated with authentication
- Exportable as JSON
- Filterable by action type, status, user, and date range
- Includes timestamps, user info, IP tracking placeholder, and user agent

**API:**
```typescript
addAuditLog(userId, userEmail, action, status, details?);
getAuditLogs(): AuditLogEntry[];
filterAuditLogs(logs, filters);
exportAuditLogs(): string;
clearAuditLogs(): void;
```

### 2. Audit Log Viewer Component (`src/components/admin/audit-log-viewer.tsx`)

Beautiful, filterable UI for viewing security events:
- âœ… Search by email, action, or details
- âœ… Filter by action type (login, logout, password change, etc.)
- âœ… Filter by status (success/failure)
- âœ… Color-coded badges for different event types
- âœ… Success/failure icons
- âœ… Export logs to JSON file
- âœ… Clear all logs (with confirmation)
- âœ… Full dark mode support
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… Shows timestamp, user, action, and details

### 3. System Backup Functionality (`src/lib/system-backup.ts`)

Complete backup/restore system:
- âœ… Backs up all system data (users, messages, recipients, settings, audit logs)
- âœ… Exports as JSON with version and timestamp
- âœ… Download backup to local device
- âœ… Restore from backup (future enhancement)
- âœ… Backup statistics (size, item counts, last backup date)
- âœ… Automatic audit logging of backup events

**Features:**
```typescript
createSystemBackup(userId, userEmail): Promise<BackupData>;
downloadBackup(backup, filename?): void;
restoreFromBackup(backupData, userId, userEmail): Promise<void>;
getBackupStats(): { lastBackup, totalSize, itemCounts };
```

### 4. System Backup Dialog Component (`src/components/admin/system-backup-dialog.tsx`)

User-friendly backup interface:
- âœ… Shows last backup date and time
- âœ… Displays total data size (formatted)
- âœ… Lists item counts per data type
- âœ… One-click backup creation
- âœ… Automatic file download
- âœ… Success/error messaging
- âœ… Auto-close after successful backup
- âœ… Full dark mode support
- âœ… Loading states

### 5. Non-Functional Feature Indicator (`src/components/ui/non-functional-indicator.tsx`)

**IMPORTANT: Easy-to-Remove Visual Indicator System**

A reusable component that adds a small animated red dot to non-functional features:
- âœ… Animated pulsing red dot in top-right corner
- âœ… Tooltip on hover explaining feature status
- âœ… Global toggle to hide all indicators at once
- âœ… Wraps buttons and interactive elements
- âœ… Zero impact on existing functionality

**How to Remove ALL Indicators:**
1. Open `src/components/ui/non-functional-indicator.tsx`
2. Change line: `const SHOW_INDICATORS = true;` to `const SHOW_INDICATORS = false;`
3. Or delete the file and remove all imports

**Or Remove Selectively:**
Just unwrap the component:
```tsx
// Before
<NonFunctionalIndicator>
  <Button>Click Me</Button>
</NonFunctionalIndicator>

// After
<Button>Click Me</Button>
```

## ðŸ”´ Features Marked as Non-Functional

Currently marked with red dot indicators:
1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** - Admin Profile â†’ Security tab
2. **API Keys Management** - Admin Profile â†’ Security tab

## âœ… Functional Features

These features are now **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**:
1. **Password Management** - User Profile & Admin Profile
2. **Audit Logs** - Admin Profile â†’ Security tab â†’ "View Logs"
3. **System Backup** - Admin Profile â†’ Security tab â†’ "Backup Now"

## Integration Points

### Authentication Flow
Audit logging is automatically integrated into:
- âœ… Login success (tracked in auth state change)
- âœ… Login failure (tracked in login function)
- âœ… Logout (tracked before sign out)
- âœ… Failed login attempts (with error details)

### Admin Profile Updates
- âœ… Profile updates are logged with success/failure status
- âœ… Password changes are logged (in PasswordChangeSection)
- âœ… Settings changes can be logged (infrastructure ready)

## Usage

### For Admins: Audit Logs
1. Go to **Admin** â†’ **Profile**
2. Click **Security** tab
3. Click **View Logs** button
4. Use filters to search:
   - Search box: Filter by email, action, or details
   - Action dropdown: Filter by specific event type
   - Status dropdown: Filter by success/failure
5. Export logs: Click **Export** button
6. Clear logs: Click **Clear All** (requires confirmation)

### For Admins: System Backup
1. Go to **Admin** â†’ **Profile**
2. Click **Security** tab
3. Click **Backup Now** button
4. Review backup statistics:
   - Last backup date
   - Total data size
   - Item counts per category
5. Click **Create Backup**
6. Backup file downloads automatically (JSON format)

## Technical Details

### Data Structure

**Audit Log Entry:**
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  user_id: string;
  user_email: string;
  action: AuditAction;
  details?: string;
  ip_address?: string;
  user_agent?: string;
  status: 'success' | 'failure';
}
```

**Backup Data:**
```typescript
{
  version: string;
  timestamp: string;
  data: {
    users?: any[];
    messages?: any[];
    recipients?: any[];
    settings?: any;
    auditLogs?: any[];
  };
}
```

### Storage

- **Audit Logs**: `localStorage` key: `legacyScheduler_auditLog`
- **Last Backup**: `localStorage` key: `legacyScheduler_lastBackup`
- **Limit**: 1000 most recent audit log entries
- **Format**: JSON

### Files Modified

1. `src/lib/audit-log.ts` - âœ¨ NEW - Audit logging utilities
2. `src/lib/system-backup.ts` - âœ¨ NEW - Backup/restore utilities
3. `src/components/admin/audit-log-viewer.tsx` - âœ¨ NEW - Audit log UI
4. `src/components/admin/system-backup-dialog.tsx` - âœ¨ NEW - Backup UI
5. `src/components/ui/non-functional-indicator.tsx` - âœ¨ NEW - Feature indicator
6. `src/pages/admin/admin-profile.tsx` - Updated with new features
7. `src/lib/auth-context.tsx` - Added audit logging integration

### Dependencies

No new dependencies required! Uses existing:
- `react-hook-form`
- `date-fns`
- `lucide-react` (icons)
- UI components from `@/components/ui`

## Security Considerations

### Audit Logs
- Logs are stored client-side in localStorage
- Contains sensitive information (user emails, actions)
- Can be cleared by admin
- Export includes all historical data
- **Future**: Move to server-side database for better security

### Backups
- Complete system export including all user data
- Downloaded to user's device (client-side)
- JSON format (human-readable, easy to restore)
- Includes audit logs in backup
- **Future**: Encrypt backups before download

### Non-Functional Indicator
- Pure visual component
- No impact on security
- No data collection
- Easy to remove globally
