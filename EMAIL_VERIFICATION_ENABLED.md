# Email Verification Enabled

## Changes Made

### ✅ Supabase Configuration
- Updated `supabase/config.toml`
- Set `enable_confirmations = true` in `[auth.email]` section
- Users must now verify their email before signing in

### ✅ Sign Up Page Updates
- Updated success message to instruct users to check their email
- Message: "Account created successfully! Please check your email to verify your account before signing in."
- Added dark mode support to success alert

### ✅ Sign In Page Updates
- Added specific error handling for unverified emails
- Shows user-friendly message: "Please verify your email address before signing in. Check your inbox for the confirmation link."

### ✅ Auth Context Updates
- Updated console logs to reflect email verification requirement
- Removed misleading "automatically signed in" comment

## How It Works Now

### New User Registration:
1. User fills out sign-up form (name, email, password)
2. Account is created in Supabase
3. Supabase sends verification email to user's inbox
4. User sees success message telling them to check email
5. User must click verification link in email
6. After verification, user can sign in

### Sign In Attempt Before Verification:
- User tries to sign in with unverified email
- System blocks login and shows: "Please verify your email address before signing in"

## Email Template

Supabase will use the default confirmation email template which includes:
- Confirmation link
- "Confirm your email" button
- Expires in 1 hour (configurable in `otp_expiry`)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Custom Email Templates
You can customize the verification email by:
1. Creating `supabase/templates/confirmation.html`
2. Uncommenting and updating the template path in `config.toml`:
```toml
[auth.email.template.confirmation]
subject = "Verify your email - Legacy Scheduler"
content_path = "./supabase/templates/confirmation.html"
```

### Production SMTP Configuration
For production, configure a real SMTP server in `config.toml`:
```toml
[auth.email.smtp]
enabled = true
host = "smtp.sendgrid.net"
port = 587
user = "apikey"
pass = "env(SENDGRID_API_KEY)"
admin_email = "support@yourapp.com"
sender_name = "Legacy Scheduler"
```

### Resend Verification Email
Consider adding a "Resend verification email" button on the sign-in page for users who didn't receive the email.

## Security Benefits

✅ Ensures users provide valid email addresses
✅ Prevents fake/temporary email abuse
✅ Confirms user ownership of email account
✅ Required for password reset functionality
✅ Better user data quality

## Testing

To test locally:
1. Restart Supabase services to apply config changes
2. Sign up with a real email address
3. Check your inbox for the verification email
4. Click the confirmation link
5. Sign in with your verified account
