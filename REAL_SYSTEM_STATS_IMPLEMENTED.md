## 📊 Data Sources

### Real Data From:
1. **Supabase Database**
   - Total user count (actual database query)
   
2. **localStorage** 
   - Messages (all statuses and types)
   - Recipients
   - Audit logs
   - Activity tracking
   - Backup timestamps

3. **Audit Log System**
   - Login attempts (24h)
   - Failed logins (24h)
   - Success rate calculation
   - New user tracking

4. **Activity Tracking** (NEW!)
   - User presence tracking

---

## 🎯 How "Online Now" Works

### Activity Tracking
```typescript
// Automatically tracks user activity:
1. On login - immediate track
2. Every 5 minutes - periodic update
3. Stores timestamp in localStorage

// User is "online" if:
- Activity timestamp within last 15 minutes
- Green pulsing dot indicator
```

### Implementation Details
- **Track Interval**: 5 minutes
- **Online Threshold**: 15 minutes
- **Active Threshold**: 7 days
- **Storage Key**: `legacyScheduler_userActivity`

---

## 🧪 Testing

### How to Verify It Works

1. **Open Admin Profile**
   - Go to Admin → Profile → System Settings tab
   - You should see real data instead of "1,247, 5,842" etc.

2. **Check "Online Now"**
   - Should show "1" (you!)
   - Green pulsing dot should be visible
   - Number updates every 30 seconds

3. **Create a Message**
   - Create a new draft message
   - Go back to statistics
   - "Total Messages" should increase
   - "Drafts" should increase

4. **Activity Tracking**
   - After 15 minutes of inactivity, you'll show as offline
   - Any interaction marks you as online again

5. **Failed Login Test**
   - Try to login with wrong password
   - "Failed Logins (24h)" should increment
   - "Login Success Rate" should decrease

## 📝 Notes

### Current Limitations
- **Multi-device Detection**: Same user on multiple devices counts as one
- **Real IP Addresses**: Not available (browser security)
- **Uptime Calculation**: Currently static 99.9% (needs server monitoring)
- **Historical Trends**: No time-series data yet

### Storage Considerations
- Activity tracking adds ~1KB per user to localStorage
- Minimal performance impact
- Automatically cleans up on logout

### Security
- All statistics are admin-only (LEGACY plan required)
- No sensitive data exposed
- Activity tracking is privacy-friendly (timestamps only)
