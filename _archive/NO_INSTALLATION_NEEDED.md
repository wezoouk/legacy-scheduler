# NO INSTALLATION REQUIRED - Just Use Your Browser!

## What You Need
- ✅ **Your web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - any browser)
- ✅ **Your Supabase account** (you already have this)
- ✅ **Internet connection**

## What You DON'T Need
- ❌ No Docker installation
- ❌ No command line tools
- ❌ No additional software
- ❌ No terminal commands

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cvhanylywsdeblhebicj/storage/buckets
3. **Sign in** to your Supabase account (if not already signed in)

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket
1. **Click the "New bucket" button** (big blue button)
2. **Bucket name:** Type `media`
3. **Public:** Check the checkbox ✅
4. **Click "Create bucket"**

### Step 3: Set Up Permissions
1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cvhanylywsdeblhebicj/sql
2. **Copy the SQL script** from `setup-storage-bucket.sql` file
3. **Paste it** into the SQL editor
4. **Click "Run"** button

## That's It!
After these 3 steps, your video/audio recording will work again.

## Why This Happened
When I removed localStorage fallbacks, the app now requires Supabase Storage to work. The storage bucket was missing, so recordings couldn't be saved.

## Expected Result
- ✅ Video/audio recordings will save
- ✅ Files stored in Supabase Storage
- ✅ No more "not saving" issues

## If You Get Stuck
- Make sure you're signed into Supabase
- Check that you're on the right project (cvhanylywsdeblhebicj)
- The bucket name must be exactly `media`

**No installation needed - just use your browser!**
