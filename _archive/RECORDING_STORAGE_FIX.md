# Video and Audio Recording Storage Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
Recorded video and audio files were not being stored/saved properly due to a **bucket name mismatch** between the MediaService code and the Supabase storage configuration.

## Root Cause
1. **Bucket Name Mismatch**: 
   - SQL setup created bucket named `'media'`
   - MediaService was trying to upload to bucket named `'message-media'`
   - This caused all uploads to fail silently

2. **Missing Storage Bucket**: 
   - The `'media'` bucket didn't exist in the Supabase project
   - RLS policies were not properly configured

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Bucket Name Mismatch ✅
Updated `src/lib/media-service.ts` to use the correct bucket name `'media'` instead of `'message-media'`:

```typescript
// Before
bucket: string = 'message-media'

// After  
bucket: string = 'media'
```

### 2. Created Storage Bucket Setup ✅
Created `setup-storage-bucket.sql` with proper bucket configuration and RLS policies:

```sql
-- Create the media bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'media',
  'media', 
  true,
  104857600, -- 100MB limit
  ARRAY['video/mp4', 'video/webm', 'audio/mpeg', 'audio/webm', 'audio/wav', 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif']
) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- RLS policies for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload media" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'media');
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling ✅
Added better error messages in MediaService to help diagnose storage issues:

```typescript
if (error.message?.includes('bucket') || error.message?.includes('not found')) {
  throw new Error(`Storage bucket '${bucket}' does not exist. Please create it in your Supabase dashboard or run the setup-storage-bucket.sql script.`);
}
```

## How to Complete the Fix

### Step 1: Create the Storage Bucket
Run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `setup-storage-bucket.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the script

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
After creating the bucket, video and audio recordings should now be properly stored in Supabase Storage instead of falling back to localStorage.

## Fallback Behavior
The system already has robust fallback logic:
- If Supabase upload fails → Falls back to localStorage with data URLs
- If localStorage quota exceeded → Removes media recordings and continues
- Users get appropriate error messages

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/lib/media-service.ts` - Fixed bucket name and enhanced error handling
- ✅ `setup-storage-bucket.sql` - Created storage bucket setup script
- ✅ `test-storage.js` - Created test script to verify storage functionality

## Testing
The fix can be tested by:
1. Recording a video or audio message
2. Checking browser console for upload success/failure messages
3. Verifying files appear in Supabase Storage dashboard
4. Confirming recordings persist after page refresh

## Next Steps
1. Run the `setup-storage-bucket.sql` script in Supabase dashboard
2. Test recording functionality
3. Verify recordings are stored in Supabase Storage
4. Remove test files (`test-storage.js`) when done
