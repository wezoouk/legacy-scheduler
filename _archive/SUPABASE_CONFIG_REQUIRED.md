# SUPABASE CONFIGURATION REQUIRED - DASHBOARD RECORDING NOT SAVING

## Problem Identified ✅
The dashboard recording is not saving because **Supabase environment variables are missing**.

## Root Cause
- Dashboard recording uploads to Supabase Storage
- `createMessage()` fails because Supabase is not configured
- Error is caught but not shown to user
- Video appears temporarily (optimistic update) but disappears after refresh

## Solution: Configure Supabase Environment Variables

### Step 1: Create .env File
Create a file named `.env` in your project root with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://cvhanylywsdeblhebicj.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key_here
```

### Step 2: Get Your Supabase Keys
1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cvhanylywsdeblhebicj/settings/api
2. **Copy "Project URL"** → Replace `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
3. **Copy "anon public" key** → Replace `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Step 3: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What Will Happen After Configuration

### Before (Current State)
- ❌ Dashboard recording shows thumbnail temporarily
- ❌ Video disappears after refresh
- ❌ No error messages shown to user
- ❌ Supabase Storage upload fails silently

### After (Fixed State)
- ✅ Dashboard recording uploads to Supabase Storage
- ✅ Video persists after refresh
- ✅ Success/error messages shown to user
- ✅ Video appears in message list with thumbnail

## Testing Steps
1. **Configure Supabase** (steps above)
2. **Record video** in dashboard
3. **Click "Save as Message"**
4. **Should see:** "Video recording saved successfully!"
5. **Refresh page** → Video should still be there
6. **Check message list** → Video thumbnail should appear

## Error Messages You'll See
- **Success:** "Video recording saved successfully!"
- **Error:** "Failed to save video recording: [error details]"

## Console Logs to Watch For
- "Video uploaded to Supabase Storage: [URL]"
- "Saving message to Supabase database for user: [user-id]"
- Any Supabase configuration errors

## Files Modified
- `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-recording.tsx` - Added error handling and user feedback
