-- Quick Fix: Disable RLS temporarily for immediate access
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- Disable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE recipients DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE messages DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE dms_configs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE dms_cycles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE site_settings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- This will allow the migration to work immediately
-- You can re-enable RLS later with the fix-rls-policies.sql script
