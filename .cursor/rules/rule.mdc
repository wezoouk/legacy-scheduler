## Naming Conventions
- **Tables and Columns**: Always use snake case with lowercase letters (e.g., `user_data` instead of `UserData`).
- **Variables and Functions**: Also use snake case and lowercase consistently for all variable and function names (e.g., `get_user_data`).

## Error Handling
- Always log errors in a consistent format.  
- Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

## Configuration
- Store all environment-specific settings (like database URLs) in a config file or environment variables, not in the code.

## Testing and Reviews
- Ensure all code changes are reviewed or tested before deployment.  
- Maintain automated tests for critical functions.
