# AUDIO PREVIEW FIXED ✅

## Problem Identified
The audio preview dialog was showing "No Audio Found" because it was only looking for `message.audioRecording` but the gallery items use `message.cipherBlobUrl` for audio URLs.

## Root Cause
- **Audio Gallery** saves audio to `cipherBlobUrl` (Supabase Storage URL)
- **Audio Preview Dialog** was only checking `audioRecording` (legacy localStorage field)
- **Message List** was only checking `audioRecording` for audio preview buttons

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/components/dashboard/audio-preview-dialog.tsx`
- ✅ Updated `audioUrl` to check both `audioRecording` AND `cipherBlobUrl`
- ✅ Enhanced diagnostic information to show both fields
- ✅ Now works with both legacy and new audio storage

### 2. `src/components/dashboard/message-list.tsx`
- ✅ Updated audio preview button to check both `audioRecording` AND `cipherBlobUrl`
- ✅ Updated debug logging to show both audio URL fields
- ✅ Now shows audio preview buttons for gallery items

## How It Works Now

### Before (Broken)
- Audio Gallery → Saves to `cipherBlobUrl`
- Audio Preview → Only checks `audioRecording`
- Result: "No Audio Found" error

### After (Fixed)
- Audio Gallery → Saves to `cipherBlobUrl`
- Audio Preview → Checks `audioRecording` OR `cipherBlobUrl`
- Result: Audio plays correctly

## Testing Steps

### Test Audio Gallery Recording
1. **Go to Audio Messages section**
2. **Click "Click to Record"** → Record audio
3. **Click "Save"** → Enter name
4. **Should see**: "Audio recording saved to gallery!"
5. **Audio should appear** in empty box
6. **Click audio thumbnail** → Should open preview dialog
7. **Audio should play** in preview dialog

### Test Audio Preview
1. **Record audio** in gallery
2. **Click audio thumbnail** to open preview
3. **Should see audio player** with controls
4. **Click play** → Audio should play
5. **No more "No Audio Found" error**

## Expected Results
- ✅ Audio recordings save to gallery boxes
- ✅ Audio preview dialog opens correctly
- ✅ Audio plays in preview dialog
- ✅ No "No Audio Found" errors
- ✅ Works with both legacy and new audio storage
- ✅ Diagnostic information shows both URL fields

## Console Logs to Watch For
- "Audio uploaded to Supabase Storage: [URL]"
- "AudioPreviewDialog audioUrl: [URL]"
- Audio preview button clicks

**The audio recording and preview should now work correctly!**
