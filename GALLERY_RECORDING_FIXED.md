# VIDEO/AUDIO GALLERY RECORDING FIXED ✅

## Problem Identified
The **Video Gallery** and **Audio Gallery** sections were using **localStorage** (data URLs) instead of Supabase Storage, which is why recordings disappeared after refresh.

## Root Cause
Both galleries had `saveRecordingWithName()` functions that:
1. Converted Blob to data URL using `FileReader.readAsDataURL()`
2. Saved to localStorage as placeholder objects
3. Never uploaded to Supabase Storage
4. Disappeared after page refresh

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/components/dashboard/video-gallery.tsx`
- ✅ Added `MediaService` import
- ✅ Updated `saveRecordingWithName()` to upload to Supabase Storage
- ✅ Uses `cipherBlobUrl` field for video URLs
- ✅ Added success/error alerts
- ✅ Removed localStorage placeholder logic

### 2. `src/components/dashboard/audio-gallery.tsx`
- ✅ Added `MediaService` import  
- ✅ Updated `saveRecordingWithName()` to upload to Supabase Storage
- ✅ Uses `cipherBlobUrl` field for audio URLs
- ✅ Added success/error alerts
- ✅ Removed localStorage placeholder logic

## How It Works Now

### Before (Broken)
1. Record video/audio → Convert to data URL → Save to localStorage → Disappears on refresh

### After (Fixed)
1. Record video/audio → Upload to Supabase Storage → Save message to database → Persists after refresh

## Testing Steps

### Test Video Gallery Recording
1. **Go to Video Messages section**
2. **Click "Click to Record"**
3. **Record a video**
4. **Click "Save"**
5. **Enter a name**
6. **Should see:** "Video recording saved successfully!"
7. **Refresh page** → Video should still be there
8. **Check message list** → Video should appear with thumbnail

### Test Audio Gallery Recording  
1. **Go to Audio Messages section**
2. **Click "Click to Record"**
3. **Record audio**
4. **Click "Save"**
5. **Enter a name**
6. **Should see:** "Audio recording saved successfully!"
7. **Refresh page** → Audio should still be there
8. **Check message list** → Audio should appear

## Expected Results
- ✅ Video/Audio recordings save permanently
- ✅ Recordings persist after page refresh
- ✅ Videos appear in message list with thumbnails
- ✅ All media uses Supabase Storage URLs
- ✅ Success/error messages shown to user
- ✅ No localStorage fallback (as requested)

## Console Logs to Watch For
- "Video uploaded to Supabase Storage: [URL]"
- "Audio uploaded to Supabase Storage: [URL]"
- Success/error alert messages

**The Video Gallery and Audio Gallery recording should now work properly!**
