### 3. Security Features

#### Password Change Form
```typescript
const passwordChangeSchema = z.object({
  currentPassword: z.string().min(1, 'Current password is required'),
  newPassword: z.string().min(8, 'Password must be at least 8 characters'),
  confirmPassword: z.string().min(1, 'Please confirm your password'),
}).refine((data) => data.newPassword === data.confirmPassword, {
  message: "Passwords don't match",
  path: ["confirmPassword"],
});
```

#### Integration with Supabase
- Uses `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: newPassword })`
- Handles authentication errors gracefully
- Provides clear error messages to users

### 4. User Experience Improvements

- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error messages with appropriate colors

- **Dark Mode**: Full support across all components

1. **Profile Tab**
