# GALLERY RECORDING FIXED - VIDEOS/AUDIOS GO TO EMPTY BOXES ✅

## Problem Identified
The user wanted recordings from Video Gallery and Audio Gallery to go into the **empty boxes** as media storage, not automatically create messages. The recordings should be available for selection when creating messages.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Video Gallery (`src/components/dashboard/video-gallery.tsx`)
- ✅ **Upload to Supabase Storage** - Videos are stored in Supabase Storage
- ✅ **Save to empty boxes** - Videos appear in the placeholder boxes
- ✅ **localStorage persistence** - Gallery videos persist after refresh
- ✅ **No automatic message creation** - Just stores media for later use
- ✅ **Success message**: "Video recording saved to gallery!"

### 2. Audio Gallery (`src/components/dashboard/audio-gallery.tsx`)
- ✅ **Upload to Supabase Storage** - Audios are stored in Supabase Storage  
- ✅ **Save to empty boxes** - Audios appear in the placeholder boxes
- ✅ **localStorage persistence** - Gallery audios persist after refresh
- ✅ **No automatic message creation** - Just stores media for later use
- ✅ **Success message**: "Audio recording saved to gallery!"
